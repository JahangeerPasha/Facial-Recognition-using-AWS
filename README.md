# Facial-Recognition-using-AWS
In this project, we will create a robust and scalable facial recognition application using a suite of AWS services, including AWS Rekognition, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, and S3. This app will demonstrate the seamless integration of these services to provide secure and efficient facial recognition capabilities.
